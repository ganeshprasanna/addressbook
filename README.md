## Description
Addressbook consists of 4 main sections:

### Search
Search allows you to search for contacts by full or partial last name.

### Contacts
Contacts is used to manage your, you guessed it, contacts.  The contacts sections allows
you to view and edit all information for a given contact.

### Addresses
Addresses is used to manage the addresses of your contacts.  Each address has
an address type (Individual, Family, Married Couple, Unmarried Couple, etc).
The address type is used to determine the "addressee" of the address.  For
example, if Joe Smith and Jane Smith share an address, the addressee
would be the following for the specific address types:

"Individual" - "Mr. Joe Smith"  
"Family" - "Mr. & Mrs. Joe & Jane Smith & Family"  
"Married Couple" - "Mr. & Mrs. Joe & Jane Smith"  
"Unmarried Couple" - "Mr. Joe Smith & Ms. Jane Smith"  
"Single Parent" - "Mr. Joe Smith & Family"  

The home phone is also stored along with the address, since home phones are
specific to a home.  
 
You can specify the two main contacts for an address by selecting the primary
and secondary contact on the address details page.  These contacts are used
in constructing the addressee (see above).
 
### Groups
Groups provide a way to organize your contacts.  Each group has a name, and 
a list of members.  Members can be added via the "Maintain Group Members"
link.  After clicking "Maintain Group Members", you can add/remove one or more
addresses to/from the group.

Once you have members in your group, you can create a printable PDF file of
mailing labels for the members in your group.  Simply specify the type of labels
you will be using, and click the "Create Labels" link.

When printing the labels, be sure your PDF viewer is set to respect the 
margins in the document, and not to "center the document in the page" or 
perform any other types of margin alterations.
