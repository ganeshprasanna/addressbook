Minor Bugs
------------
* When a contact is deleted, any addresses where the contact is a primary contact
  are not updated with the new addressee in the address list

Enhancements
------------
* Make the primary and secondary contacts links to the actual contact
* Allow user to select font color, size, weight, and alignment for labels
